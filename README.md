# 🛡️ **AWS CloudFormation Sigma Detection Rules**

A curated collection of **Sigma rules** designed to detect suspicious or malicious activity in **AWS CloudFormation (CFN)** events. These rules help security analysts and threat hunters monitor and respond to anomalies within AWS environments using a **platform-agnostic detection format**.
